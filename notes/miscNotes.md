Koowa indentation is all over the place. Time for some aesthetic contributions/commits to svn? Probably should e-mail someone
about it. 

Need to add a glossary for confused people.

Also need to make sure I stay consistent with terms Koowa and Nooku can confuse the hell out of people if I don't.     

Perhaps a good idea in the long run to put an intro/overview of PHP patterns somewhere? An appendix.
