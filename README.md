# Intro

I'm developing several components for my Design Breakdown template/extension club. I'm documenting the process in the form of
a book. The end result will be very rough but hopefully useful enough anyway.
  
  
# Contributions

Contributions at this stage would just get in the way. I'll put out a call for contributions when I'm ready. That said, your
welcome to use any of my work in any manner at any point. Just don't expect me to accept pull requests, provide feedback,
help etc.    

# Notes

I'm using a custom system to process this; these are the basics:

1. Chapters are individual files. 
2. Everything is formatted using markdown.
3. Processed using redcarpet + custom redcarpet extensions. 
4. Code documented using Docit, a custom yaml + markdown documentation system. Allows me to do fancy stuff like include links 
to chapters/pages within a docblock.
